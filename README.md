# Linear Regression Single Variable House Pricing - Pararius

In regression problems we trying to predict continuous valued output.

Linear regression is used to predict a quantitative response Y from the predictor variable X.

Linear Regression is made with an assumption that thereâ€™s a linear relationship between X and Y.

We know the given eqaution y=mx+b represents a straight line with slope m and the y intercept b.

y=m*x+b

"m" represents the "slope" of the line. This is rise/run. 

"b" represents the "y-intercept" of the line. This is where the line cross es the y-axis (the part of the coordinate grid that goes up and down).
